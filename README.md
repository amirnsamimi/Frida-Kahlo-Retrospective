# Frida-Kahlo-Retrospective
I've been hired to work on a retrospective of Frida Kahloâ€™s work at a major museum in Mexico.  My job is to put together the audio tour, but in order to do that, I need to create a list of each painting featured in the exhibit, the date it was painted, and its spot on the tour using my knowledge in python.
